Furthermore, we find that humans outperform ChatGPT4 in the scientific discovery process with a higher quantity and quality of proposed hypotheses, more effective searches in the experimental space with more overall experiments and more key experiments conducted, more alternative hypotheses and new experiments designed, and more aha moments during the experiments.

  "related_work": "Several recent works have addressed the challenge of efficiently processing long sequences with Transformers.  Early approaches like the Linformer (Wang et al., 2020) and Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) focused on reducing the quadratic complexity of self-attention by approximating the attention matrix.  Linformer achieves this through low-rank factorization, projecting the key and value matrices into lower-dimensional spaces, thus reducing computational cost.  However, this projection can lead to information loss, resulting in accuracy degradation on longer sequences.  Performer, on the other hand, utilizes a fast kernel approximation based on orthogonal random features, offering a more efficient alternative.  Despite its speed advantage, Performer's accuracy can still be suboptimal compared to the standard Transformer, particularly for complex tasks.  The Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs locality-sensitive hashing to reduce the computational complexity of attention, enabling the processing of longer sequences.  However, the hashing process introduces approximation errors that can affect the model's performance.  These methods, while significantly improving efficiency, often compromise accuracy, particularly for longer sequences.  This trade-off between efficiency and accuracy motivates our research to explore novel techniques that mitigate the accuracy loss inherent in these efficient Transformer architectures.  Further research into attention mechanisms has explored alternative approaches such as sparse attention (Child et al., 2019), which focuses on attending only to a subset of the most relevant tokens, thereby reducing computational complexity.  However, selecting the relevant tokens effectively remains a challenge.  Our work builds upon these existing efforts by [Clearly state your approach and how it addresses the limitations of previous work].  We aim to improve the accuracy of efficient Transformers without significantly increasing computational cost, addressing the identified gap in the literature."
